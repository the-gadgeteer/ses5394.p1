My name is Ethan Kita, I am a student at MIT in the Technology and Policy Program, interested in exploring transportation policy through this course and my research in developing nonmonetary incentives for a microtransit (ride-sharing) service in Tulsa, OK. I received my BS in Computer Engineering at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.
